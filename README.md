# Job Lead Tracker Chrome Extension
### Tab Saver/ Link Bookmarker

Lol. This can be called many things but this Chrome extension basically can save the tabs that you're currently on or from direct input into the text field. Whatever you choose, it will be saved as a link and rendered to the list under the buttons. These links are saved to local storage so even if you close the window or open a new one, the links will stay. Links open up in a new tab (because we always need more of those open, yes?)

Single click to save input or tab.
Double click to delete all links in list.

Download the code, and type chrome://extensions into your browser window to get to you local extensions page.
Click the Load Unpacked button near the top left.
When the prompt comes up, choose the folder with the code
